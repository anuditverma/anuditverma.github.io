Hi! Here is the list of __Incredibly Useful macOS Apps__ that I have curated. You should probably use them to enhance your macOS experience (or I can say it turns you into a superuser). And they are FREE! Yes, free as in free beer. I have been using them for quite a while now. I find them incredibly useful. Whether you have a _MacBook Air_, _MacBook Pro_, _iMac_, _Mac Studio_ or _Mac Pro_, these work great.

The list is in no particular order. All Apps are equally great in their relative terms of usage.

<h3>1. Helium</h3>

<img src="/assets/img/macos_apps/helium.jpg" height="120" width="98" align="right" alt="Helium">

Picture in Picture (PIP), this App provides a floating window on your Mac screen. On this floating window, you can play your favourite video. The video can be from the Internet, using a link or your video content while simultaneously working on other Apps. The App is developed by Jaden Geller and featured on Product Hunt and Business Insider! Although it is no longer maintained, you can view the archive project on GitHub.

<h3>2. Mounty</h3>

If you use NTFS formatted UBS pen drives interchangeably between Windows and macOS, then you must use this tiny handy tool. It re-mounts write-protected NTFS volumes under macOS in read-write mode. I guess, needless to say, more about it.

<h3>3. DeskCover</h3>

<img src="/assets/img/macos_apps/deskcover.jpg" height="95" width="120" align="right" alt="DeskCover">

“DeskCover hides your desktop icons behind a beautiful cover and automatically highlights the active application’s window while hiding everything else.” YES! That’s what the developer says. Isn’t it cool?

<h3>4. Activity Timer</h3>
